## Introduction

BinExport is the exporter component of
[BinDiff](https://www.zynamics.com/software.html) as well as
[BinNavi](https://github.com/google/binnavi). It is a plugin for the commercial
IDA Pro disassembler and exports disassemblies into the Protocol Buffer format
that BinDiff requires. Exporting into a PostgreSQL databases for BinNavi is
supported on a best-effort basis.

An experimental version for the open source sofware reverse engineering suite
Ghidra is available in the `java/BinExport` directory.

This repository contains the complete source code necessary to build the IDA Pro
plugin for Linux, macOS and Windows.

## Installation

Download the binaries from the release page and copy them into the IDA Pro
plugins directory. These are the default paths:

| OS      | Plugin path                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | `/opt/idapro-7.4/plugins`                   |
| macOS   | `/Applications/IDA Pro 7.4/idabin/plugins`  |
| Windows | `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\IDA 7.4\plugins`       |

To install just for the current user, copy the files into one of these
directories instead:

| OS          | Plugin path                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Linux/macOS | `~/.idapro/plugins`                  |
| Windows     | `%AppData%\Hex-Rays\IDA Pro\plugins` |


## Usage

The main use case is via [BinNavi](https://github.com/google/binnavi). However,
BinExport can also be used to export IDA Pro disassembly to files of various
formats:

*   Protocol Buffer based full export
*   Statistics text file
*   Text format for debugging
*   BinNavi database export into a PostgreSQL database

### Verifying the installation version

1.  In IDA, select `Help`|`About programm...`
2.  Click `Addons...`
3.  If installed correctly, the following dialog box appears:

    ![IDA addons dialog](/doc/binexport10-ida-addons-dialog.png)

### Invocation

#### Via the UI

1.  Open an IDB
2.  Select `Edit`|`Plugins`|`BinExport 11`
3.  The following dialog box appears:

    ![BinExport plugin dialog](/doc/binexport10-plugin-dialog.png)

4.  Select the type of the file to be exported

Note: There is no UI for the database export.

### IDC Scripting

The BinExport plugin registers the IDC functions below.

| IDC Function name   | Exports to           | Arguments                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| BinExportSql¹       | PostgreSQL database  | host, port, database, schema, user, password |
| BinExportDiff       | Protocol Buffer      | filename                                     |
| BinExportText       | Text file dump       | filename                                     |
| BinExportStatistics | Statistics text file | filename                                     |

¹Note: Exporting into PostgreSQL databases is deprecated and requires the
`ENABLE_POSTGRESQL` define to be set.

*Deprecated*: BinExport also supports exporting to a database via the
`RunPlugin()` IDC function:

```c
static main() {
  batch(0);
  auto_wait();
  load_and_run_plugin("binexport11", 1);
  qexit(0);
}
```

Use the plugin options listed below to setup the database connection in that
case. See also the `CBinExportImporter` class in BinNavi.

#### IDAPython

The option flags are the same as IDC (listed above).

```python
import idaapi
idc_lang = idaapi.find_extlang_by_name("idc")
idaapi.run_statements(
    'BinExportSql("{}", {}, "{}", "{}", "{}", "{}")'.format(
        "host", 5432, "database", "public", "user", "pass"), idc_lang)
```

### Plugin Options

BinExport defines the following plugin options, that can be specified on IDA's
command line:

| Option                                  | Description                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-OBinExportAutoAction:<ACTION>`        | Invoke a BinExport IDC function and exit                               |
| `-OBinExportModule:<PARAM>`             | Argument for `BinExportAutoAction`                                     |
| `-OBinExportHost:<HOST>`¹               | Database server to connect to                                          |
| `-OBinExportPort:<PORT>`¹               | Port to connect to. PostgreSQL default is 5432.                        |
| `-OBinExportUser:<USER>`¹               | User name                                                              |
| `-OBinExportPassword:<PASS>`¹           | Password                                                               |
| `-OBinExportDatabase:<DB>`¹             | Database to use                                                        |
| `-OBinExportSchema:<SCHEMA>`¹           | Database schema. BinNavi only uses "public".                           |
| `-OBinExportLogFile:<FILE>`             | Log messages to a file                                                 |
| `-OBinExportAlsoLogToStdErr:TRUE`       | If specified, also log to standard error                               |
| `-OBinExportX86NoReturnHeuristic:FALSE` | Disable the X86-specific heuristic to identify non-returning functions |

Note: These options must come before any files.

¹Note: Exporting into PostgreSQL databases is deprecated and requires the
`ENABLE_POSTGRESQL` define to be set.

## How to build

### Preparing the build environment

As we support exporting into PostgreSQL databases as well as a Protocol Buffer
based format, there are quite a few dependencies to satisfy:

*   Boost 1.67.0 or higher (a partial copy of 1.71.0 ships in
    `third_party/boost_parts`)
*   [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.12 or higher
*   GCC 7 or a recent version of Clang on Linux/macOS. On Windows, use the
    Visual Studio 2017 compiler (Update 9 or later) and the Windows SDK
    for Windows 10.
*   Git 1.8 or higher
*   IDA SDK 7.4 (unpack into `third_party/idasdk`)
*   OpenSSL 1.0.2 or higher
*   Perl 5.6 or higher (needed for OpenSSL and PostgreSQL)
*   Optional: PostgreSQL client libraries 9.3 or higher
*   Protocol Buffers 3.6.1 or higher

### Linux

#### Prerequisites

The preferred build environment is Debian testing (version 10, "Buster").

This should install all the necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt update -qq
sudo apt install -qq --no-install-recommends build-essential cmake
```

The following sections assume that your current working directory is at the root
of the cloned repository.

#### IDA SDK

Unzip the contents of the IDA SDK into `third_party/idasdk`. Shown commands are
for IDA 7.4:

```bash
unzip PATH/TO/idasdk74.zip -d third_party/idasdk
mv third_party/idasdk/idasdk74/* third_party/idasdk
rmdir third_party/idasdk/idasdk74
```

#### Build BinExport

With all prerequisites in place, configure and build BinExport:

```bash
mkdir -p build_linux && cd build_linux
cmake ../cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES=OFF \
    -DIdaSdk_ROOT_DIR=$PWD/../third_party/idasdk
cmake --build .
```

This will download and build OpenSSL, Protocol Buffers and the PostgreSQL client
libraries. If all went well, the `build_linux/binexport-prefix` directory should
contain two IDA plugin binaries `binexport11.so` and `binexport1164.so` for use
with `ida` and `ida64`, respectively.

To enable support for exporting into PostgreSQL databases, add
`-DBINEXPORT_ENABLE_POSTGRESQL=ON` to the first CMake command.


### macOS

#### Prerequisites

The preferred build environment is Mac OS X 10.14 "Mojave" using Xcode 9.
Using macOS 10.15 "Catalina" should also work.

After installing the Developer Tools, make sure to install the command-line
tools:

```bash
sudo xcode-select --install
```

Recent versions of the Developer Tools no longer include GNU Autotools, which is
required by the PostgreSQL dependency. You can install Autotools via
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (recommended) or via
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php). Follow the installation
instructions on the respective websites.

For Homebrew:

```bash
brew install autoconf automake libtool
```

For MacPorts:

```bash
sudo /opt/local/bin/port install autoconf automake libtool
```

The following sections assume that your current working directory is at the root
of the cloned repository.

#### CMake

Download the latest stable version of CMake from the official site and mount its
disk image:

```bash
curl -L https://cmake.org/files/v3.12/cmake-3.12.4-Darwin-x86_64.dmg \
    -o $HOME/Downloads/cmake-osx.dmg
hdiutil attach $HOME/Downloads/cmake-osx.dmg
```

At this point you will need to review and accept CMake's license agreement. Now
install CMake:

```bash
sudo cp -Rf /Volumes/cmake-3.12.4-Darwin-x86_64/CMake.app /Applications/
hdiutil detach /Volumes/cmake-3.12.4-Darwin-x86_64
sudo /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui --install
```

The last command makes CMake available in the system path.

#### IDA SDK

Unzip the contents of the IDA SDK into `third_party/idasdk`. Shown commands are
for IDA 7.4:

```bash
unzip PATH/TO/idasdk74.zip -d third_party/idasdk
mv third_party/idasdk/idasdk74/* third_party/idasdk
rmdir third_party/idasdk/idasdk74
```

#### Build BinExport

With all prerequisites in place, configure and build BinExport:

```bash
mkdir -p build_mac && cd build_mac
cmake ../cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES=OFF \
    -DIdaSdk_ROOT_DIR=$PWD/../third_party/idasdk
cmake --build .
```

This will download and build OpenSSL, Protocol Buffers and the PostgreSQL client
libraries. If all went well, the `build_mac/binexport-prefix` directory should
contain two IDA plugin binaries `binexport11.dylib` and `binexport1164.dylib`
for use with `ida` and `ida64`, respectively.

To enable support for exporting into PostgreSQL databases, add
`-DBINEXPORT_ENABLE_POSTGRESQL=ON` to the first CMake command.


### Windows

The preferred build environment is Windows 10 (64-bit Intel) using the Visual
Studio 2017 compiler and the [Windows SDK for Windows
10](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/downloads/windows-10-sdk).

#### CMake

Download and install CMake from its [download
page](https://cmake.org/download/). Make sure to select "Add CMake to the system
PATH for all users".

#### Git

Download and install Git from its [download
page](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Make sure to select the following
options: * The installation directory should be left at the default
`%ProgramFiles%\Git\bin\git.exe` * "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" -
have the setup utility add Git to your system path. * "Use Windows' default
console window" - to be able to use Git from the regular command prompt.

### Perl

Download and install ActiveState Perl from its [download
page](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads). This should add Perl to
the system path.

#### Prepare

The following sections assume an open command prompt with the current working
directory located at the root of the cloned BinExport repository:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/google/binexport.git
cd binexport
```

#### IDA SDK

Unzip the contents of the IDA SDK into `third_party/idasdk`. Shown commands are
for IDA 7.4, assuming that Git was installed into the default directory first:

```bat
"%ProgramFiles%\Git\usr\bin\unzip" PATH\TO\idasdk74.zip -d third_party
rename third_party\idasdk74 idasdk
```

#### Build BinExport

With all prerequisites in place, configure and build BinExport:

```bat
if not exist build_msvc mkdir build_msvc
cd build_msvc
cmake ../cmake -DIdaSdk_ROOT_DIR=%cd%\..\third_party\idasdk ^
    -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
cmake --build . --config Release --install -- /m /clp:NoSummary;ForceNoAlign /v:minimal
```

This will download and build OpenSSL, Protocol Buffers and the PostgreSQL client
libraries. If all went well, the `build_msvc\binexport-prefix` directory should
contain two IDA plugin binaries `binexport11.dll` and `binexport1164.dll` for use
with `ida.exe` and `ida64.exe`, respectively.

To enable support for exporting into PostgreSQL databases, add
`-DBINEXPORT_ENABLE_POSTGRESQL=ON` to the first CMake command.
